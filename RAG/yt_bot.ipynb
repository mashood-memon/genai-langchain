      "and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology\n",
      "and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is\n",
      "Dr. Lex Fridman Dr. Lex Fridman is an expert\n",
      "in electrical and computer engineering, artificial\n",
      "intelligence, and robotics. He is also the host of the\n",
      "Lex Fridman Podcast, which initially started\n",
      "as a podcast focus on technology and\n",
      "science of various kinds, including computer\n",
      "science and physics, but rapidly evolved to include\n",
      "guests and other topics as a matter of focus,\n",
      "including sport. For instance, Dr. Lex\n",
      "Freedman is a Black Belt in Brazilian jujitsu. And he's had numerous\n",
      "guests on who come from the fields\n",
      "of Brazilian jujitsu, both from the coaching side\n",
      "and from the competitor side. He also has shown\n",
      "an active interest in topics such as chess\n",
      "and essentially anything that involves intense activation\n",
      "and engagement of the mind and/or body. In fact, the Lex\n",
      "Fridman podcast has evolved to take on\n",
      "very difficult topics such as mental health-- he's\n",
      "had various psychiatrists and other guests on that\n",
      "relate to mental health and mental illness, as well as\n",
      "guest focused on geopolitics and some of the more\n",
      "controversial issues that face our times. He's had comedians, he's had\n",
      "scientists, he's had friends, he's had enemies on his podcast. Lex has a phenomenal, I would\n",
      "say a 1 in an eight billion ability to find these people,\n",
      "make them comfortable, and in that comfort, both\n",
      "try to understand them and to confront them and to\n",
      "push them so that we all learn. All of which is to say that\n",
      "Lex Fridman is no longer just an accomplished scientist,\n",
      "he certainly is that. But he has also become one of\n",
      "the more preeminent thought leaders on the planet. And if there's anything\n",
      "that really captures the essence of Lex\n",
      "Fridman, it's his love of learning, his desire to share\n",
      "with us, the human experience, and to broaden that experience\n",
      "so that we all may benefit. In many ways, our discussion\n",
      "during today's episode captures the many\n",
      "facets of Lex Fridman, although no conversation, of\n",
      "course, could capture them all. We sit down to the\n",
      "conversation just days after Lex returned from\n",
      "Ukraine, where he deliberately placed himself into the\n",
      "tension of that environment in order to understand the\n",
      "geopolitics of the region and to understand\n",
      "exactly what was happening at the level of the\n",
      "ground and the people there. You may notice that he carries\n",
      "quite a lot of both, emotion and knowledge and understanding. And yet in a very\n",
      "classic Lex Fridman way, you'll notice that\n",
      "he's able to zoom out of his own experience around\n",
      "any number of different topics and view them through\n",
      "a variety of lenses so that first of all, everyone\n",
      "feel included, but most of all, so that everyone learned\n",
      "something new, that is to gain new perspective. Our discussion also ventures\n",
      "into the waters of social media and how that\n",
      "landscape is changing the way that science and\n",
      "technology are communicated. We also get into the topics of\n",
      "motivation drive and purpose, both finding it and executing\n",
      "on that drive and purpose. I should mention that this is\n",

      "Lex Fridman Podcast long before I was ever invited\n",
      "on to the podcast as a guest. And after our first\n",
      "recording, Lex was the one that suggested\n",
      "that I start a podcast. He only gave me two\n",
      "pieces of advice. The first piece of advice\n",
      "was, start a podcast. And the second\n",
      "piece of advice was that I not just make it me\n",
      "blabbing into the microphone and staring at the camera. So I can safely say\n",
      "that I at least followed half of his advice, and that\n",
      "I am ever grateful for Lex, both as a friend, a\n",
      "colleague in science, and now fellow podcaster for\n",
      "making the suggestion that we start this podcast. I already mentioned\n",
      "a few of the topics covered on today's podcast. But I can assure you that\n",
      "there is far more to the person that many of us\n",
      "know as Lex Fridman. If you are somebody interested\n",
      "in artificial intelligence, engineering, or robotics,\n",
      "today's discussion is most certainly for you. And if you are not,\n",
      "but you are somebody who is interested in world\n",
      "politics, and more importantly, the human experience,\n",
      "both the individual and the collective\n",
      "human experience, Lex shares what can\n",
      "only be described as incredible insights\n",
      "into what he views as the human experience and what\n",
      "is optimal in order to derive from our time on this planet. Before we begin, I'd\n",
      "like to emphasize that this podcast is separate\n",
      "from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of\n",
      "my desire and effort to bring zero cost to\n",
      "consumer information about science and\n",
      "science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with\n",
      "that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors\n",
      "of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink\n",
      "with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes,\n",
      "sodium, potassium, and magnesium are in LMNT\n",
      "in the correct ratios. But it has no sugar. As I mentioned before\n",
      "on the podcast, electrolytes are\n",
      "critical to the function of every cell in the\n",
      "body, and especially the cells in your brain,\n",
      "meaning neurons or nerve cells. Indeed, the ability\n",
      "for nerve cells to be active and communicate\n",
      "with one another critically depends on sodium,\n",
      "potassium, and magnesium. You can get electrolytes\n",
      "from a variety of sources. But it's often hard to get\n",
      "them in the proper ratios, even from food. So if you're somebody who's\n",
      "exercising a lot and sweating, or if you're somebody\n",
      "following, for instance, a low carbohydrate or even a\n",
      "semi-low carbohydrate diet, that will cause you to\n",
      "excrete electrolytes. I tend to have my\n",
      "LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up\n",
      "or within the first few hours of waking, any time while\n",
      "or after I'm exercising, or I've sweat a lot, such\n",
      "as exiting the sauna. If you'd like to try LMNT\n",

      "LMNT.com/Huberman to my free sample pack. Today's episode is also\n",
      "brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program\n",
      "that lets you see how different foods affect\n",
      "your health by giving you real-time feedback on your\n",
      "diet using a continuous glucose monitor. Now blood glucose or blood\n",
      "sugar is a critical aspect of your immediate\n",
      "and long term health, and indeed, your\n",
      "feelings of vigor and mental clarity and\n",
      "well-being at any moment. One of the key things is to know\n",
      "how different foods and food combinations and\n",
      "timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose. And with Levels,\n",
      "you're able to assess all of that in real time. I tried Levels. And what it taught\n",
      "me, for instance, was that I can eat certain\n",
      "foods at certain times of day. But if I eat them at\n",
      "other times a day, I get a blood sugar crash. It also taught me,\n",
      "for instance, how to space my exercise\n",
      "and my food intake. It turns out for me, exercising\n",
      "fasted is far more beneficial. That's something I\n",
      "learned using Levels. And it's completely\n",
      "transformed, not just the spacing and timing\n",
      "of my diet and exercise, but also use of things like\n",
      "the sauna and other activities. It's been a tremendous\n",
      "learning for me that's really shaped an enormous\n",
      "number of factors in my life that have led to me feeling\n",
      "far more vigorous with far more mental focus and physical\n",
      "strength and endurance. So if you're interested in\n",
      "learning more about Levels and trying a continuous\n",
      "glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/Huberman. Again that's levels.link,\n",
      "L-I-N-K/Huberman. Today's episode is also\n",
      "brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep make smart mattress\n",
      "covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many\n",
      "times on this podcast about the critical relationship\n",
      "between sleep and body temperature. That is in order to fall\n",
      "asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night,\n",
      "our body temperature needs to drop by\n",
      "about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely when we\n",
      "wake up in the morning, that is in large part,\n",
      "because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now people have different\n",
      "core body temperatures. And they tend to run colder or\n",
      "hotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you\n",
      "to adjust the temperature of your sleeping\n",

      "transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper,\n",

      "structured, good advice that's boiling down the\n",

      "actually useful for people. So that was impressive. It's like holy shit, he\n",

      "don't you dress properly like your friend Lex? He literally said that. And it's a debate that\n",

      "You know, I think. LEX FRIDMAN: Can you\n",
      "imagine you're here? You hear after so many\n",
      "episodes and done so much. I mean, the number of\n",
      "hours is just insane. The amount of\n",
      "passion, the amount of work you put into\n",
      "this, what's it feel like? ANDREW HUBERMAN: It feels great. And it feels very much\n",
      "like the horizon is still at the same distance\n",
      "in front of me. Every episode, I just try\n",
      "and get information there. And the process that we\n",
      "talked about on your podcast. We won't go into it of\n",
      "collecting information, distilling it down\n",
      "to some simple notes, walking around,\n",
      "listening to music, trying to figure out\n",
      "what the motifs are, and then-- as just like you,\n",
      "I don't use a teleprompter or anything like that. There's very minimal notes. So it feels great,\n",
      "and I love it. And again, I'm just grateful\n",
      "to you for inspiring it. And I just want to keep\n",
      "going and do more of it. And I should say\n",
      "I am also relieved that we're sitting here because\n",
      "you recently went overseas to a very intense war zone,\n",
      "literally, the Ukraine. And the entire time\n",
      "that you were there, I was genuinely concerned. The world's a unpredictable\n",
      "place, in general. And we don't always get the only\n",
      "vote and what happens to us. So first of all,\n",
      "welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. And what was that like? I mean, at a broad level,\n",
      "at a specific level, what drew you there? What surprised you? And how do you think it changed\n",
      "you in coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: I think\n",
      "there's a lot to say. But first, it is\n",
      "really good to be back. One of the things\n",
      "that when you go to a difficult part of the world\n",
      "or a part of the world that's going through\n",
      "something difficult, you really appreciate how\n",
      "great it is to be an American. Everything. The easy access to food. Despite what people think, the\n",
      "stable, reliable rule of law. The lack of corruption in that\n",
      "you can trust that if you start a business or if you take\n",
      "on various pursuits in life that there's not going to\n",
      "be at-scale manipulation of your efforts such\n",
      "that you can't succeed. So this kind of\n",
      "capitalism is in it's-- the ideal of capitalism is\n",
      "really still burning bright in this country. And it really makes you\n",
      "appreciate those aspects. And also just the ability to\n",
      "have a home for generations, across generations. So you can have your\n",
      "grandfather live in Kentucky in a certain city. And then his children lived\n",
      "there, and you live there, and then it just\n",
      "continues on and on. That's the kind of thing you can\n",
      "have when you don't have war. Because war destroys\n",
      "entire communities. And it destroys\n",
      "histories, generations, like life stories that stretch\n",
      "across the generations. So-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. I didn't even think about\n",
      "that until you said just now. But photographs, hard drives\n",
      "get destroyed or just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. I mean, nowadays, things\n",
      "exist in the cloud but are still a lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "--material goods that are irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even in rural\n",
      "parts of the United States, they don't exist in\n",

      "they talk about. That, in fact, they\n",
      "don't mention actually with much dramatic sort\n",
      "of vigor about the trauma of losing your home. They're just non-stop saying\n",
      "how lucky they are that person X person Y is still here. And that makes you realize\n",
      "that when you lose everything, it's still-- it makes you realize\n",
      "what really matters, which is the people\n",
      "in your life. I mean, a lot of people kind\n",
      "of realize that later in life, when you're facing mortality,\n",

      "but what matters is still the family, the\n",
      "people, and so on. I think the most intense thing-- I talked to several hundred\n",
      "people, some of which is recorded. I've really been\n",
      "struggling to put that out because I have to\n",
      "edit it myself. And so you're talking about 30,\n",

      "It is extremely difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you\n",
      "like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN: It's\n",
      "extremely difficult. So I talked to a\n",
      "lot of politicians. The number two in the\n",
      "country, number three. I'll be back there to\n",
      "talk to the president to do a three-hour conversation. Those are easy to edit. They're really heartfelt\n",

      "on the geopolitics of the war. But the ones that\n",
      "really hard to edit is like grandmas that are\n",
      "in the middle of nowhere. They lost everything. They still have hope,\n",
      "they still have love. And some of them have-- some of them, many of\n",
      "them, unfortunately, have now hate in their heart. So in February, when\n",
      "Russia invaded Ukraine, this is the thing I\n",
      "realized about War. One of the most\n",
      "painful one lessons is that war creates\n",
      "generational hate. We sometimes think about war\n",
      "as a thing that kills people, kills civilians, kills\n",
      "soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. But we don't\n",
      "directly think about the secondary and\n",
      "tertiary effects of that which lasts decades. Which is anyone who's lost\n",
      "the father or a mother or a daughter or a son,\n",
      "they now hate not just the individual\n",
      "soldiers or the leaders that invaded their country but\n",
      "the entirety of the people. So it's not that they\n",
      "hate Vladimir Putin or hate the Russian military. They hate Russian people. So that tears the\n",
      "fabric of a thing that, for me-- my half\n",
      "my family's from Ukraine, half of my family\n",
      "is from Russia. But there is-- I remember the pain the\n",
      "triumph of World War two still resonates through\n",
      "my entire family tree. And so, you remember when\n",
      "the Russians and Ukrainians fought together against\n",
      "this Nazi invasion. You remember a lot of that. And now, to see the fabric\n",
      "of this peoples torn apart completely with hate is really,\n",
      "really difficult. For me, just to realize that\n",
      "things will just never be the same on this particular\n",
      "cultural, historical aspect. But also, there's so many\n",
      "painful ways in which things will never be the same. Which is we've seen that\n",
      "it's possible to have a major hot war in\n",
      "the 21st century. I think a lot of people\n",
      "are watching this. China is watching this. India is watching this. United States is watching this\n",
      "and thinking we can actually have a large-scale war. And I think the lessons\n",
      "learned from that. Might be the kind that lead\n",
      "to a major World War III in the 21st century. So one of the things I realized\n",
      "watching the whole scene is that we don't know\n",
      "shit about what's going to happen in the 21st century. And it might-- we kind of have\n",
      "this intuition like surely there's not going\n",

      "And back to normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back to normal-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "Whatever that is. LEX FRIDMAN: But you\n",
      "have to remember, at the end of World War I,\n",
      "as Woodrow Wilson called it, the war to end all wars. Nobody ironically,\n",
      "in a dark way, it was also the roaring 20s\n",
      "when people believed this. There will never be\n",
      "another World War. And 20 years after that,\n",
      "the rise of Nazi Germany. A charismatic leader\n",
      "that captivated the minds of\n",

      "to see every aspect of. It's still fueling that division\n",
      "between America and China. Between Russia and India. And then Africa has\n",

      "of really intense language, full of hate from\n",
      "every side toward me. Or, well, the hate is\n",
      "towards me as representing side X. And X stands as a\n",

      "and the narratives, but they are-- the\n",

      "ultimately the thing that helps them and helps everyone\n",
      "is to feel love for fellow man, but they can't help it. They know. It's like a drug, they\n",
      "say like hate escalates, it's like a vicious spiral. You just can't help it. And the question I\n",
      "also asked is, do you think you'll ever be\n",
      "able to forgive Russia? And after much thought almost-- it's split, but most\n",
      "people will say no. I will never be able to forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And because\n",
      "of the generalization you talked about earlier, that\n",
      "could even include all Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: All Russians. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "In that statements, they mean all Russians. LEX FRIDMAN: Because\n",
      "if you do nothing that's as bad or worse\n",

      "that are just quietly going on with their lives, you're\n",
      "just as bad, if not worse, is their perspective. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "Earlier, you said that going over\n",
      "to the Ukraine now allowed you to\n",
      "realize just so many of the positives of being\n",
      "here in the United States. I have a good friend. We both know him. I won't name him\n",
      "by name, but we've communicated the\n",
      "three of us from tier-one Special Operations. He spent years\n",

      "tickets, and there's lines to vote and things like that. But I think the pandemic\n",
      "was one of the first times, at least in my life, that I\n",
      "can remember where it really seemed like the government was\n",
      "impeding what people naturally wanted to do. And that was a shock\n",
      "for people here. And I have a what might\n",
      "seem like a somewhat mundane question,\n",
      "but it's something that I saw on social media. A lot of people were\n",

      "deprived conditions over there? I saw a couple photos\n",
      "that you posted out of doors in front of rubble. With pith helmet on in one case. What was that typical\n",
      "day like over there? LEX FRIDMAN: So\n",
      "there's two modes. One of them-- I spent\n",
      "a lot of time in Kyiv, which is much safer than-- it may be obvious to state\n",
      "but for people who don't know, it's in the middle\n",
      "of the country, and it's much safer\n",
      "than the actual front. The word the battle\n",
      "is happening. So much, much safer\n",
      "than Kyiv even is Lviv which is the\n",
      "Western part of the country. So the times I\n",
      "spent in Kyiv were fundamentally different than\n",
      "the time I spent at the front. And I went to the\n",
      "Kherson region, which is where a lot of really\n",
      "heated battle was happening. There's several areas. So there's Kharkiv. It's in the Northeast\n",
      "of the country. And then there's Donbas region,\n",
      "which is East of the country. And then there's Kherson\n",
      "region, which, by the way, I'm not good at geography, so\n",
      "is the Southeast of the country. And that's where, at\n",
      "least when I was there, was a lot of really\n",
      "heated fighting happening. So when I was in\n",
      "the Kherson region, it's what you would imagine. The place-- I stayed in a\n",
      "hotel where all the lights have to stay off. So the entire town,\n",
      "all the lights are off. You have to navigate\n",
      "through the darkness and use your phone\n",
      "to shine, and so on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is\n",
      "terrible for the circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.\n",
      "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: That's exactly-- I was this-- how can I do this? Where's my element\n",
      "and Athletic Greens? How can I function? No. There's I think it was balanced\n",
      "by the deep appreciation of being alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "Right now I-- mean, this is the reason\n",
      "that I asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "This is the reason I ask is we get used to all\n",
      "these creature comforts. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\n",
      "we don't need them, but we often come\n",
      "to depend on them in a way that makes us\n",
      "feel like we need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,\n",
      "but very quickly, there's something about\n",
      "the intensity of life that you see in people's\n",
      "eyes because they're living through a war that makes\n",
      "you forget all those creature comforts. And it was actually-- I'm somebody who hates\n",
      "traveling and so on. I love the creature habits. I love-- I love the\n",
      "comfort of the ritual right but all of that was\n",
      "forgotten very quickly. Just the intensity of\n",
      "feeling, the intensity of love that people have for\n",
      "each other, that was obvious. In terms of food-- so there's a curfew. So depends on what\n",
      "part of the country. But usually, you basically have\n",
      "to scamper home like 9:00 PM. So the hard curfew in a lot of\n",
      "places is 11:00 PM at night. But by then, you\n",
      "have to be home. So-- in some places, it's 10:00. So at 9:00 PM, you\n",
      "start going home. Which, for me, was\n",
      "kind of wonderful also because I get to spend-- I get to be forced to spend time\n",
      "alone and think for many hours in wherever I'm staying. Which is really nice. And everywhere there's a\n",
      "calmness and the quietness to the whole thing. In terms of food, once a day. Just the food is incredibly\n",
      "cheap and incredibly delicious. People are still--\n",
      "one of the things they can still take pride\n",
      "in is making the best possible food they can. So meat-- but they do\n",
      "admire American meat, so the meat is not as great as\n",
      "it could be in that country. But I ate borsch every day,\n",
      "all that kind of stuff. Mostly meat. So spend the entire day-- wake up in the\n",
      "morning with coffee, spend the entire day\n",
      "talking to people. Which for me is very\n",
      "difficult because of the intensity of the story. It's one after the\n",
      "other after the other. We just talk to regular\n",
      "people, talk to soldiers, talk to politicians,\n",
      "all kinds of soldiers. I talked to people there who\n",

      "this is the thing. He really embodies that. Now, some of that is just\n",
      "his personality and humor. I'd like to sort of comment\n",

      "teams that rescue, that go into the most dangerous areas\n",
      "of Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, and\n",
      "they get the job done. And one of the things I\n",
      "heard time and time again, which what's really\n",
      "interesting to me, that Ukrainian soldiers said\n",
      "that comparing Ukrainian, Russian, and American\n",
      "soldiers, American soldiers are the bravest, which was\n",
      "very interesting for me to hear given how\n",

      "realities of war kind of wake you up to what needs to get\n",
      "done to protect sovereignty, to protect some of the values,\n",
      "to protect civilians and homes and all that kind of stuff. Sometimes war has to happen. And I should also\n",

      "truth is a very difficult thing to arrive with in that war zone. I think in the 21st\n",
      "century one of the things you realize that so much of war,\n",
      "even more so than in the past, is an information war. And people that just use Twitter\n",
      "for their source of information might be surprised to know\n",
      "how much misinformation there is on Twitter, like real\n",
      "narratives being sold, and so it's really hard\n",

      "people that suffer. And that's just visible\n",
      "time and time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned\n",

      "we have a guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "We have one here. It'll be\n",
      "straightforward for you. I always say that the\n",
      "adrenaline comes in waves, and so if you just\n",
      "think about it walls, like you're going through a\n",
      "number of walls of adrenaline as opposed to going for time,\n",
      "it becomes rather trivial. With your jujitsu\n",
      "background and what you'll immediately recognize\n",
      "the physiological sensation. Even though it's\n",
      "cold specifically, it's the adrenaline\n",
      "that makes you want to hop out of the thing. LEX FRIDMAN: And\n",
      "you've seen Joe's. So Joe set up a\n",
      "really nice man cave-- or it's not even a cave\n",
      "because it's so big. It's like a network\n",
      "of man caves. But it has a ice bath and\n",
      "a sauna next to each other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We have one of\n",
      "those here, ice bath and sauna. So we'll have to get you\n",
      "in it one of these days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds\n",
      "like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe\n",
      "tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although there is a-- I don't know the underlying\n",
      "physiological basis but there does seem to\n",
      "be a trend toward truth telling in the sauna. Some people will refer\n",
      "to them as truth barrels. Mine's a barrel sauna\n",
      "shaped like a barrel. Who knows why? Maybe under intense\n",
      "heat duress people just feel compelled to share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I have\n",
      "a complicated relationship with saunas because of\n",
      "all the weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. LEX FRIDMAN: Some of\n",
      "the deepest suffering-- sorry to interrupt-- I've done was in the sauna. It's very-- I mean, I've gone\n",
      "to some dark places in a sauna because, I mean, I wrestled\n",
      "my whole life, judo, jujitsu, and those weights cuts\n",
      "can really test the mind. So you're-- truth telling. Yeah, it's a certain\n",
      "kind of truth telling because\n",
      "you're sitting there and the clock moves slower than\n",
      "it has ever moved in your life. Yeah. So I usually, for\n",
      "the most part, I would try to have a bunch of\n",
      "sweats, garbage bags, and all that kind of stuff, and run. It's easier because you\n",
      "can distract the mind. In the sauna you can't\n",
      "distract the mind. It's just and all the excuses\n",
      "and all the weaknesses in your mind just\n",
      "coming to the surface, and you're just sitting there\n",
      "and sweating-- or not sweating. That's the worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And talk\n",
      "about visual aperture. You're in a small box so it also\n",
      "inspires some claustrophobia even if you're not\n",
      "claustrophobic. That's absolutely true. And the desire to just\n",
      "get out of the thing is where you get a pretty\n",
      "serious adrenaline surge from in the sauna as well. Now, the sauna actually will-- it won't deplete testosterone\n",
      "but it kills sperm. So for people that-- sperm are on a 60\n",
      "day sperm cycle so if you're trying\n",
      "to donate sperm-- because that's what\n",
      "got us on to this-- or fertilize an egg or\n",
      "eggs in whatever format, dish or in vivo, as we say\n",
      "in science, which means-- well, you can look it up, folks. The 60 day sperm cycle. So if you go into\n",
      "a really hot sauna or a hot bath or a\n",
      "hot tub, in 60 days those sperm are going to be-- a significantly\n",
      "greater portion of them will be dead, will\n",
      "be non-viable. So there's a simple solution. People just put ice pack down\n",
      "there or a jar, not this jar, but a jar of cold fluid between\n",
      "their legs and just sit there, or they go back and\n",
      "forth between the ice bath and the sauna. But you probably-- if you're\n",
      "going to go back over there you should freeze sperm. We're going to do a couple\n",
      "episodes on fertility when it's relatively inexpensive. And you're young so\n",
      "you probably do it now because there is a association\n",
      "with autism as males get older. It's not a strong one. It's significant but it's\n",
      "still a small contribution to the autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: As you age\n",
      "don't sperm get wiser or no? There's no science to back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but men\n",
      "can conceive healthy children at a considerable age. But in any case-- but no, they don't get wiser. What happens is interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it's a\n",
      "little bit like the maturation of the brain in the sense\n",
      "that some of the sperm get much better at swimming\n",
      "and then many of them get less good. Motility is a strong correlate\n",
      "of the DNA of the sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: This is\n",
      "probably a good time to announce that I'm\n",
      "selling my sperm as an NFTs. I wanted to see how much that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding\n",
      "the crypto wave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, your\n",
      "children, your future children and my future children, are\n",
      "supposed to do jujitsu together since I've only done\n",
      "the one jujitsu class so I'm strongly vested\n",
      "in you having children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But only\n",
      "in the friendly kind of way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition\n",
      "kind of way. Yeah. Dominance of the clan. Yep. For sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving\n",
      "on to science, but still with our minds in the Ukraine. Did you encounter any scientists\n",
      "or see any universities? As we know, in this country\n",
      "and in Europe and elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. You need buildings, you need\n",
      "laboratories, you need robots, you need a lot of equipment,\n",
      "and you need minus 80 freezers and you need incubators\n",
      "and you need money and you need technicians. And typically it's been\n",
      "the wealthier countries that have been able to\n",
      "do more research for sake of research and development\n",
      "and prioritization. Certainly the Ukraine had\n",
      "some marvelous universities and marvelous scientists. What's going on with science\n",
      "and scientists over there? And gosh, can we even\n",
      "calculate the loss of discovery that is occurring as a\n",
      "consequence of this conflict? LEX FRIDMAN: So science goes on. Before the war Ukraine had\n",
      "a very vibrant tech sector, which means engineering\n",
      "and all that kind of stuff, and Kyiv has a lot of\n",
      "excellent universities and they still go on. The biggest hit, I\n",
      "would say, is not the infrastructure\n",
      "of the science, but the fact, because\n",
      "of the high morale, everybody is joining\n",
      "the military. So everybody is\n",
      "going to the front to fight, including you, Andrew\n",
      "Huberman, would be fighting, and not because you have\n",
      "to but because you want to. And everybody you know\n",
      "would be really proud that you're fighting,\n",
      "even though everyone tries to convince, Andrew\n",
      "Huberman, you have much better\n",
      "ways to contribute. There's deep honor in fighting\n",
      "for your country, yes, but there are better ways to\n",
      "contribute to your country than just picking up a gun that\n",
      "you're not that trained with and going to the front. Still, they do it. Scientists, engineers,\n",
      "CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men and women? LEX FRIDMAN: Actors--\n",
      "men and women. Obviously, primarily\n",
      "men, but men and women. Much more than you would\n",
      "see in other militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody wants to fight. Everybody's proud of fighting. There's no discussion\n",
      "of pacifism. Should we be fighting? Is this right? Is this-- everybody's\n",
      "really proud of fighting. So there's this\n",
      "kind of black hole that pulls everything,\n",
      "all the resources, into the war effort that's\n",
      "not just financial but also psychological. So it's like if you're a\n",
      "scientist it feels like what-- it feels almost like\n",
      "you're dishonoring humanity by continuing to do things\n",
      "you were doing before. There's a lot of people that\n",
      "converted to being soldiers. They literally watch\n",
      "a YouTube video of how to shoot\n",
      "a particular gun, how to arm a drone\n",
      "with a grenade. If you're a tech\n",
      "person you know how to work with drones so\n",
      "you're going to use that, use whatever skills you got,\n",
      "figure out whatever skills you got and how to use them to\n",
      "help the effort on the front. And so that's a big hit. But that said, I've talked\n",
      "to a lot of folks in Kyiv-- faculty primarily in the\n",
      "tech economics space, so I didn't get a chance\n",
      "to interact with folks who are on the biology, chemistry,\n",
      "neuroscience side of things, but that still goes on. So one of the really\n",
      "impressive things about Ukraine is that they're able to maintain\n",
      "infrastructure like road, food supply, all that kind of stuff,\n",
      "education, while the war is going on, especially in Kyiv. The war started\n",
      "where nobody knew whether Kyiv was going to be\n",
      "taken by the Russian forces. It was surrounded. And a lot of experts from\n",
      "outside were convinced that Russia would take\n",
      "Kyiv, and they didn't. And one of the really\n",
      "impressive things as a leader-- one of the things I\n",
      "really experienced is that a lot of people\n",
      "criticized Zelenskyy before the war. He only had about\n",
      "30% approval rate. A lot of people\n",
      "didn't like Zelenskyy. But one of the\n",
      "great things he did as a leader, which I'm not\n",
      "sure many leaders would be able to do, is when Kyiv\n",
      "was clearly being invaded he chose to stay. He stayed in the capital. Everybody, all the American\n",
      "military, the intelligence agencies, NATO, his own staff,\n",
      "advisors all told him to flee, and he stayed. And so I think that was a\n",
      "beacon, a symbol for the rest, for the universities,\n",
      "for science, for the infrastructure\n",
      "that we're staying too, and that kept the\n",
      "whole thing going. There's an interesting social\n",
      "experiment that happened, I think for folks who\n",
      "are interested in gun control in this\n",
      "country in particular, is one of the decisions\n",
      "they made early on is to give guns to everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "Early on in the war? LEX FRIDMAN: Early\n",
      "on in the war, yeah. So everybody got a gun. They also released\n",
      "a bunch of prisoners from prison because\n",
      "there was no staff to keep the prisons running. And so there's a\n",
      "very interesting psychological experiment of,\n",
      "like, how is this going to go? Everybody has a gun. Are they going to\n",
      "start robbing places? Are they going to\n",
      "start taking advantage of a chaotic situation? And what happened is\n",
      "that crime went to zero. So it turned out that\n",
      "this, as an experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a\n",
      "case where love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or\n",
      "at least hate did not. We don't know if it's\n",
      "love or it's sort of lack of initiative for common\n",
      "culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. I don't-- right. I think that's very correct\n",
      "to say that it wasn't hate that was unifying people. It was love of country,\n",
      "love of community. It's probably the same thing\n",
      "that will happen to humans when aliens invade as well. It's the common effort. Everybody puts everything\n",
      "else to the side. Plus just the sheer amount\n",
      "of guns is similar to Texas. You realize, well,\n",
      "there's going to be a self-correcting mechanism very\n",
      "quickly because the rule of law was also put aside, right? Basically the police\n",
      "force lost a lot of power because everybody else\n",
      "has guns and they're kind of taking the law\n",
      "into their own hands. That system, at least\n",
      "in this particular case in this particular moment\n",
      "in human history, worked. It's an interesting\n",
      "lesson, you know? ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is. I had an interesting contrast\n",
      "that I'll share with you because you mentioned Texas. So not so long ago\n",
      "I was in Austin. I often visit you or others\n",
      "in Austin, as you know. And many doors that I walked\n",
      "past, including a school, said no firearms\n",
      "past this point. It was a sticker on the door. You see this on\n",
      "hospitals sometimes. I saw this at Baylor College\n",
      "of Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common\n",
      "to see in Texas, not so common in California. And then I flew to the\n",
      "San Francisco Bay Area, was walking by an elementary\n",
      "school in my old neighborhood, and saw a similar\n",
      "sticker and looked at it and it said, no peanuts\n",
      "or other allergy containing foods past\n",
      "this point on the door of this elementary school. So quite a different\n",
      "contrast, guns and peanuts. Now, peanut allergies,\n",
      "obviously, are very serious for some people, although\n",
      "there's great research out of Stanford showing that\n",
      "early exposure to peanuts can prevent the allergies. But don't start rubbing yourself\n",
      "in peanut butter, folks, if you have a peanut allergy. That's not the best\n",
      "way to deal with it. In any case, the\n",
      "contrast of what's dangerous, the contrast of\n",
      "the familiarity with guns versus no familiarity. In Israel and elsewhere you see\n",
      "machine guns in the airport. In Germany, Frankfurt, you see\n",
      "machine guns in the airport. Not so common in\n",
      "the United States. So again, I feel like there's\n",
      "this aperture of vision. There's this aperture of\n",
      "pleasures versus creature comforts and lack of\n",
      "creature comforts, and then there's this\n",
      "aperture of danger, right? People who are\n",
      "familiar with guns are familiar with people\n",
      "coming in and setting their firearm on the table\n",
      "and eating dinner, you know? But if you're not accustomed\n",
      "to that it's jarring, right? LEX FRIDMAN: I should mention-- people know this\n",
      "throughout human history-- but the human ability\n",
      "to get assimilated now, get used to violence\n",
      "is incredible. So you could be living\n",
      "in a peaceful time, like we're here now, and\n",
      "there would be one explosion, like a 9/11 type of situation. That would be a huge shock. It's terrifying. Everybody freaks out. The second one is a huge drop\n",
      "off in how freaked out you get. And in a matter of\n",
      "days, sometimes hours, it becomes the normal. I've talked to so many\n",
      "people in Kharkiv, which is one of the towns that's\n",

      "right answer with that one is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I feel\n",
      "that money plays a role here. When people think\n",
      "big pharma, they think billions of dollars-- maybe even trillions\n",
      "of dollars, really. And certainly people who make a\n",
      "lot of money get scrutiny that others don't. Part of it is that they are\n",
      "often not always visible, but I think that there is\n",
      "a natural and reflexive-- and I'm not justifying it. I certainly don't\n",
      "feel this because I know some people who\n",
      "are very wealthy, some people who are very poor. I can't say it scales\n",
      "with happiness at all. People are always\n",
      "shocked to hear that, but that's what I've observed\n",
      "in very wealthy people. But that people who\n",
      "have a lot of money are often held to a\n",
      "different standard because people resent\n",
      "that, some people resent that, and maybe there are\n",
      "other reasons as well. I mean, among people\n",
      "who are very wealthy, oftentimes the wish\n",
      "is for status, right? Not money. You get a bunch of\n",
      "billionaires in a room, and unless one of\n",
      "them is Elon, who also has immense status\n",

      "rarer form of uniqueness out there, a\n",
      "positive uniqueness-- if one considers status positive\n",
      "because there's a downside to. So I wonder whether or not the\n",
      "Pfizer CEO caught extra heat because people\n",
      "assume, and I probably assume also, that his\n",
      "salary is quite immense. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. So because I have a\n",
      "lot of data on this. I can answer it. It's a very good hypothesis. Let's test that scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's about to\n",
      "tell me it's a great hypothesis but it's wrong. I know the smirk. I know the smirk. LEX FRIDMAN: I honestly\n",
      "think it's wrong. That effect is there\n",
      "for a lot of people, but I think the distrust\n",
      "is not towards the CEO. The distrust is\n",
      "towards the company. One of the really\n",
      "difficult soul searching I had to do, which is just having\n",
      "to interact with Pfizer folks at every level, from\n",
      "junior to the CEO, they're all really nice people. They have a mission. They talk about trying\n",
      "to really help people because that's the\n",
      "best way to make money is to come\n",
      "up with medicine that helps a lot of people. The mission is clear. They're all good people, a lot\n",
      "of really brilliant people, PhDs. So you can have a system\n",
      "where all the people are good, including the CEO. And by good, I mean\n",
      "people that really are trying to do everything. They dedicate their\n",
      "whole life to do good. And yet, you have to think\n",
      "that that system can deviate from a path that does good\n",

      "the more money you make, the more good you'll\n",
      "be able to do. And then you start to focus\n",
      "more and more and more on making more money, and then\n",
      "you can really deviate and lose track of what is actually good. I'm not saying necessarily\n",
      "Pfizer does that, but I think companies\n",
      "could do that. You can apply that criticism\n",
      "to social media companies, to big pharma companies. One of the big lessons for me-- I don't know what the answer\n",
      "is, but that all the people inside the company\n",
      "can be good, people you would want to\n",
      "hang out with, people you would want to work with,\n",
      "but as a company is doing evil. That's a possibility. So the distrust I don't think\n",

      "see a lot of in this case. I think it's Wall\n",
      "Street distrust, that the machinery of this\n",
      "particular organization has gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's the\n",
      "generalization of hate again. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. And then good luck\n",
      "figuring out what is true. This is the tough stuff. But I should say\n",
      "the individuals-- individual scientists\n",
      "at the NIH and Pfizer are just incredible people. They're really brilliant people. I never trust the administration\n",
      "or the business people-- no offense, business people. But the scientists\n",
      "are always good. They have the right\n",

      "scientists to achieve whatever end they want. But if you just look narrowly\n",
      "at the journey of a scientist, it's a beautiful one\n",

      "threat of curiosity to try to discover\n",

      "pretty good rule of thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: I think a\n",

      "most nervous systems work, but it's decision based, right? It's not because his\n",
      "musculature is a certain way or he had CRISPR or something. It's because he decides that. And I think that's\n",
      "amazing, but what it means in terms of\n",
      "starting a company and changing priorities is\n",
      "a closing the hatch on all or many of the current\n",
      "sources of dopamine so that you can derive\n",

      "context, and there's a very reductionist view\n",
      "and neurocentric view of what we're talking about. But I think about this a lot. I mean, the decision to choose\n",

      "other opportunities, right? So I think that the\n",
      "decision to order one thing off the menu versus others\n",

      "yourself to the world. So in academia,\n",
      "in the tech world, at Google, everybody was wearing\n",

      "me think of that is probably Richard Feynman. I see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He was\n",
      "a wonderful human being. LEX FRIDMAN: I see him as the\n",
      "epitome of class and humor and brilliance, and\n",
      "obviously I could never come close to that kind of-- be able to simply explain\n",
      "really complicated ideas and to have humor and wit,\n",
      "but definitely aspire to that. And then there's\n",
      "just the Mad Men, that whole era of the '50s,\n",
      "the classiness of that. There's something\n",
      "about a suit that both removes the importance\n",
      "of fashion from the character. You see the person. I think not to-- I forgot who said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel\n",
      "or somebody like this. Is that you wear a shabby dress\n",
      "and everyone sees the dress. You wear a beautiful dress\n",
      "and everybody sees the woman. So in that sense it was-- hopefully I'm quoting\n",
      "that correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX FRIDMAN: I think\n",
      "there's a sense in which a simple, classy suit\n",
      "allows people to focus on your character and then do\n",
      "so with the full responsibility of that, this is who I am. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love\n",
      "that, and I love what you said just prior to that. My father, who, again,\n",

      "like you do always said to me growing\n",
      "up, if you overdress slightly, at least people know\n",
      "that you took them seriously. So it's a sign of respect for\n",
      "your audience too in my eyes. Someone asked, is there an AI\n",

      "through unconventional activation patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, I don't know exactly\n",
      "how psychedelics work, but you can see that with\n",
      "all the diffusion models now with Dali and the\n",
      "stable diffusion that generates from text, art. It's basically a small\n",
      "injection of noise into a system that has\n",
      "a deep representation of visual information. So it is able to convert text to\n",
      "art in introducing uncertainty into that noise into that. That's kind of maybe. I could see that as a\n",

      "a different journey through jujitsu, as people know. For me, the black belt\n",

      "for people who know jujitsu, the size of tournament divisions\n",
      "for blue belts and purple belts is just humongous. Like Worlds, when I competed\n",
      "at Worlds it was, like, 140 people in a division,\n",
      "which means you have to win-- I forget how many times,\n",

      "in their life where they can-- no kids, nothing. They can dedicate\n",

      "try this jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, you should. But it's a different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "Well, I tried it. I did the one class, but I\n",
      "really want to embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: As you know,\n",
      "many pursuits like jujitsu are different if you're doing it\n",
      "in your 20s and 30s and later. It's like it's a different-- you're not-- you can have a\n",

      "crazy and he's still super competitive on\n",
      "that, so some people can-- Jocko is somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n",
      "Well, whatever they're doing they're doing something\n",
      "right because they're still in it, and that's\n",
      "super impressive. There were far too many\n",
      "questions to ask all of them, but several, if not many, asked\n",

      "get the great pleasure of being in the question\n",
      "asker seat today. And so, what is your\n",
      "advice to young people? LEX FRIDMAN: So I just\n",
      "gave a lecture at MIT and the amount of love I\n",
      "got there is incredible. And so of course, who\n",
      "you're talking to is usually undergrads, maybe young\n",
      "graduate students, and so there one person did ask for advice\n",
      "as a question at the end. I did a bunch of Q&A. So my\n",
      "answer was that the world will tell you to find a work-life\n",
      "balance, to explore, to try to-- try different fields\n",
      "to see what you really connect with, variety,\n",
      "general education, all that kind of stuff. And I said in your\n",
      "20s I think you should find one thing\n",
      "you're passionate about and work harder at that than\n",
      "you worked at anything else in your life. And if it destroys\n",
      "you, it destroys you. That's advice for in your 20s. I don't know how universally\n",
      "true that advice is, but I think at least\n",
      "give that a chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice\n",
      "towards a thing you really care about,\n",
      "and work your ass off. That said, I've\n",
      "met so many people, and I'm starting to\n",
      "think that advice is best applied or best tried in\n",
      "the engineer disciplines, especially programming. I think there's a bunch of\n",
      "disciplines in which you can achieve success\n",
      "with much fewer hours, and it's much more\n",
      "important to actually have a clarity of\n",
      "thinking and great ideas and have an energetic mind. The grind in certain disciplines\n",
      "does not produce great work. I just know that in computer\n",
      "science and programming it often does. Some of the best people ever\n",
      "that have built systems, have programmed systems are\n",
      "usually like the John Carmack kind of people that drink\n",
      "soda, eat pizza, and program 18 hours a day. So I don't know actually. You have to, I think, really\n",
      "go discipline specific. So my advice applies\n",
      "to my own life which has been mostly\n",
      "spent behind that computer, and for that you really, really\n",
      "have to put in the hours. And what that means\n",
      "is essentially it feels like a grind. I do recommend that you should\n",
      "at least try it in your own. That if you interview some of\n",
      "the most accomplished people ever, I think if\n",
      "they're honest with you they're going to\n",
      "talk about their 20s as a journey of a lot of pain\n",
      "and a lot of really hard work. I think what really\n",
      "happens, unfortunately, is a lot of those successful\n",
      "people later in life will talk about\n",
      "work-life balance. They'll say, you\n",
      "know what I learned from that process is that it's\n",
      "really important to get, like, sun in the morning,\n",
      "to have health, to have good relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire a chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, a chef. Exactly. But I think you have\n",
      "forgot-- those people have forgotten the value\n",
      "of the journey they took to that lesson. I think work-life balance is\n",
      "best learned the hard way. My own perspective. There are certain things you\n",
      "can only learn the hard way, and so you should learn\n",
      "that the hard way. Yeah, so that's\n",
      "definitely advice. And I should say that I\n",
      "admire people that work hard. If you want to get\n",
      "on my good side, I think there are the\n",
      "people that give everything they got towards something. It doesn't actually\n",
      "matter what it is, but towards achieving\n",
      "excellence in a thing. That's the highest thing that\n",
